/*The task:
• Develop a class of a Trapezoid geometric shape, defined on a plane by linear dimensions. 
• Provide the functionality to verify the existence of a figure with stated dimensions, implement functions to calculate its area and perimeter. 
• Can use a console application with a command-line interface, WinForms or WPF application as a UI-interface.
Important (!): 
• The geometric shape should not display anything on the screen or read anything from the screen. 
• After creating a shape, you cannot change its linear dimensions.
• There should not be any default constructor since a figure with zero linear dimensions cannot exist. We do not want to create an object in a deliberately erroneous state.
• The comments of the calculation methods should contain a description of the formulas used to calculate them, or the names of such formulas. 
• There must be “prompts for input”, and the display of the result, so that the user understands what is displayed.
